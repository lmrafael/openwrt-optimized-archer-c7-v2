This is a modified build of the firmware found [here](https://github.com/infinitnet/lede-ar71xx-optimized-archer-c7-v2) configured by r00t ([discussion](https://forum.lede-project.org/t/1382)) that includes various patches from [gwlim](https://github.com/gwlim/mips74k-ar71xx-lede-patch).

It uses the Qualcomm SFE driver (fast path) from [this patch](https://github.com/lede-project/source/pull/1269) by dissent1 ([discussion](https://forum.lede-project.org/t/4582)).

The package selection and configuration was partially intended for personal use and is overall lighter.
