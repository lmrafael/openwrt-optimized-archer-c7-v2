This is a modified build of the firmware found [here](https://github.com/infinitnet/lede-ar71xx-optimized-archer-c7-v2) compiled by r00t ([discussion](https://forum.lede-project.org/t/gcc-6-3-build-optimized-tp-link-archer-c7-v2-ac1750-lede-firmware/1382)) that includes various patches from [gwlim](https://github.com/gwlim/mips74k-ar71xx-lede-patch). It uses the Qualcomm SFE driver (fast path) from [this patch](https://github.com/lede-project/source/pull/1269) by dissent1 ([discussion](https://forum.lede-project.org/t/qualcomm-fast-path-for-lede/4582)). The package selection and configuration was intended for personal use. To determine the differences, just diff the config.
